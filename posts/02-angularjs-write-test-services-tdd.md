AngularJS write & test servies in the right why... TDD? 
===

In era of everyone is saying at every talk and meetup etc... "Agile and TDD" as a religion,
do people write code in TDD? I know it's hard... but we know the reward in later stages of project.

For me best place to start writing TDD is in AngularJS service/factory abstraction.
I'm always writing (or trying to write) small self canting functions that on input consume data, 
transform and return data. In JavaScript world we have tools to write elegant and small code that
easily can be tested ( produce code coverage for our CI environment ). 

My stack for testing JavaScript ( not only AngularJS ): 
 - GruntJS || GlupJS
 - KarmaJS
 - Jasmine || Mocha && Chai
 - PhantomJS || CasperJS

lest start to write some code...
