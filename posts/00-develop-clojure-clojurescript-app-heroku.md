Develop clojure/clojurescript app on heroku
===

My another aproche to create a dev blog about my adventures.
Story short i wanted to write my own blog and learn something...
i was looking on clojure long time, my good friend is clojure freak (we where 
living together so i was hearing everyday that how beautiful it all is)

my stack:
   - emacs
   - clojure 
   - clojurescript / om
   - db ? 
   - docker ? 
   - deploy on heroku 
   - arch linux

I use Emacs for my pretty all my development (without java), 
so the idea is pretty simple: 
   - create a git repo on github: [piecyk-blog](https://github.com/piecyk/piecyk-blog) 
   - store posts as markdown and code
   - add git hook after push to call clojure app to sync with repository

first we prepare our environment (maybe i will use docker later)
 - emacs      
 - java 7
 - leiningen
 - git
